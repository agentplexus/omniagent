# Release Notes: v0.4.0

**Release Date:** 2026-03-01

## Overview

OmniAgent v0.4.0 migrates the project to the plexusone organization and integrates the batteries-included omnivoice package with its provider registry pattern.

## Highlights

- **Organization Migration** - Module path changed from `github.com/agentplexus/omniagent` to `github.com/plexusone/omniagent`
- **Batteries-Included OmniVoice** - Simplified voice integration with automatic provider registration

## Breaking Changes

### Module Path Change

The module path has changed:

```go
// Old
import "github.com/agentplexus/omniagent"

// New
import "github.com/plexusone/omniagent"
```

Update your `go.mod`:

```bash
go get github.com/plexusone/omniagent@v0.4.0
```

## Changes

### Voice Processor Refactoring

The voice processor now uses OmniVoice's registry pattern:

```go
// Old approach (direct provider imports)
import "github.com/plexusone/omnivoice-deepgram"
provider := deepgram.New(apiKey)

// New approach (registry pattern)
import (
    "github.com/plexusone/omnivoice"
    _ "github.com/plexusone/omnivoice/providers/all"
)
provider, _ := omnivoice.GetSTTProvider("deepgram", omnivoice.WithAPIKey(apiKey))
```

Benefits:

- Single import for all providers
- Runtime provider selection
- Consistent configuration interface

### Removed Dependencies

- `github.com/plexusone/omnivoice-deepgram` - Now included via omnivoice
